# ActButton

It is a software for MQTT button.
On pressing button it:
* switches its power on
* connects to a Wifi
* connects to a MQTT server
* sends a message to a topic you setup (voltage * 1000)
* switches itself off

(above takes several seconds)

# Setup

If the button was not setup or can not connect to wifi or you continue to
press button for long time (about 12 sec) it will create Wifi network for
setup (then you can release button).

Default wifi for setup is "ActButton" and password is "ab1234567890ab" (it
can (and shoud!) be changed in setup). When you connect to the setup Wifi all web
connections will redirected to the button setup web page.
On the setup page there is http buttons:
* OK - save parameters and shutdown
* CANCEL - shutdown
* RESET - remove setup (format data partition of the esp8266 flash) and shutdown
